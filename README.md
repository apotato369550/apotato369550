## 🌸 Featured Projects

### 💻 [**Vaporwave Portfolio**](#)
Check it out. I love Vaporwave 🌆  
> *built with Next.js, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.*

### 🧮 [**GDG Enrollmate**](#)
An irregular student scheduler powered by a home-brewed algorithm. My take on the University Timetabling Problem  
> *Next.js + Supabase + Chrome Extension.*

### 🧠 [**DIY Machine Learning Library**](#)
*Ever wondered how those Scikitlearn machine learning models worked?* I did! And instead of digging into their source code I decided to build them myself because why not 🫠  

> Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means, Naïve Bayes...and more soon to come! *(all from scratch.)*

### 🔮 [**Graph Theory Research**](#)
Fun fact: The idea for this project came when our professor said she'd give us a flat one (4.0) if we could come up with an algorithm for the TSP. It's been a few months since then and I think I'm on to something.
> Exploring anchor-based greedy heuristics for approximating the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## ☀️ Current Focus
- Crunching commits like it's cereal 🥣
- Migrating to **Linux** and learning Bash maybe 🐧  
- Contemplating whether the egg came first or the chicken (who knows?) 🥚🐔
- Automating workflows with **n8n** 🚀 
- If you drop soap in a puddle, does the soap become dirty or the puddle become clean? 🧼 
- Building and experimenting on agents with **Gemini CLI** </> 
- Refining vaporwave portfolio **estetiks** 🌆 
- Writing. A lot. (Check out my Medium!) 🖊️
