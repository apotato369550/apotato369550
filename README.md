### 🧠 [**DIY Machine Learning Library**](https://github.com/apotato369550/diy-machine-learning-models)
*Ever wondered how those Scikitlearn machine learning models worked?* I did! And instead of digging into their source code I decided to build them myself because why not 🫠

### 🐕 [**sysdawg**](https://github.com/apotato369550/sysdawg)
A sysadmin CLI assistant that literally just vibes with Mistral 7B to help me manage my homelab. Because who doesn't want an AI dog helping with server management?

### 🏠 [**homelab-manager**](https://github.com/apotato369550/homelab-manager)
Bash script that helps me keep tabs on all my servers without losing my mind. SSH wizardry, real-time monitoring, bandwidth testing - the whole shebang.

**[🔴 LIVE - IN DEVELOPMENT](https://starship.dcism.org/)**
Real-time multiplayer territory control game with full vaporwave vibes. Build colonies, dominate the grid, vibe to neon aesthetics. It's live and it's chaotic.

## ☀️ Current Focus
- FULLY migrated to **Linux** (PC, laptop, and ALL servers running either Ubuntu or Mint) and LOVING IT 🐧
- Pushing **Gemini CLI** & **Claude Code** to their very limits (seriously, check the commit messages lol)
- Evolved into a homelab-loving gremlin 🏠
- Explored crypto, found out it was lame (or is it?) 💸
- Shamefully vibe coding the pain away or something 🎵
- Removed Herobrine ⛏️
- Gossiping with local LLMs (hi Mistral 7B) 🤖
- Crunching commits like it's cereal 🥣
- Contemplating whether the egg came first or the chicken (who knows?) 🥚🐔
