# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal portfolio repository containing:
- **README.md**: A personal portfolio showcase written in HTML/Markdown, featuring a vaporwave aesthetic with tech stack, featured projects, and current focus areas.
- **brain_dump.txt**: Notes and planning document for the README structure and personal philosophy.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as the user's public-facing portfolio presence. It's primarily a static documentation repository rather than an active development project.

## Working with This Repository

### README.md Structure

The README is styled with inline HTML and uses:
- Centered sections with `<div align="center">`
- Badge displays via shields.io for tech stacks
- Markdown formatting mixed with HTML for layout control
- Section markers for featured projects, current focus, and philosophy

When making updates:
- Maintain the vaporwave aesthetic and tone
- Keep badge consistency using the shields.io format
- Preserve the personal voice and styling

### Editing and Updating

Since this is primarily a documentation repository:
- Edit content directly in README.md for portfolio updates
- Use brain_dump.txt for planning structure changes
- Keep the git history clean with descriptive commits for portfolio updates

## Git Branches

- **main**: The primary branch, representing the published portfolio
- **new-me**: Development branch for portfolio changes

When working on portfolio updates, use the `new-me` branch and create a pull request to main when ready to publish changes.
